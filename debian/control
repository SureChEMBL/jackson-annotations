 JSON. Jackson aims to be the best possible combination of fast, correct,
 lightweight, and ergonomic for developers. It offers three alternative methods
 for processing JSON:
 .
  * Streaming API inspired by StAX
  * Tree Model
  * Data Binding converts JSON to and from POJOs

 In addition to the core library, there are numerous extension that provide
 additional functionality such as additional data formats beyond JSON,
